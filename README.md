# Yarn Desktop Client

A desktop client for Yarn ( https://yarn.social/ ).  
It's being developed with flutter.

You can reach out to me through the github issue system, or yarn:  
https://yarn.stigatle.no/user/stigatle/

Precompiled packages for various systems and snap \ appimage are planned for later.

The GTK4 version I wrote first is in the GTK4 branch.
The new flutter version is in the main branch.
